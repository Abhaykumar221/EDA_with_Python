# EDA_with_Python
Here, We are not just visualising pokemon data stats but also here we are doing some intrersting things with data.

# 1.Finding best pokemon to fight with Jolteon.
 As Pokemon have different strengths and weaknesses, a good pokemon for battle against Jolteon is one where its strength is Jolteon's weakness.

# 2.HP of Pokemon across different generations.
 Here, we are visualising the Hp of Pokemon's. 
 As identified there are outliers in the HP data , hence we are removing the outliers and sorting data accordingly.
